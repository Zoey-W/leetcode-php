## Question
```
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

## Keyword
***`array`***  ***`bit`***

## Solution
Due to the limit of complexity, use the feature of bit operation to solve it:
x^x=0，x^0=x.

## Code
```php
<?php
    /**
     * @param Integer[] $nums
     * @return Integer
     */
    function singleNumber($nums) {
        $res = 0;
        foreach($nums as $num){
            $res = $res ^ $num;
        }
        return $res;
    }
?>
```
